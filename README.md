# Dungeon Generation Algorithm

MISSING PROCEDURAL ROOM GENERATION

--

Receives the rooms and generates the triangle mesh result from Delaunay's Triangulation

Transforms the triangle mesh into a weighted graph

Applies Prim's Algorithm to get a Minimum Spanning Tree

Creates simples hallways to connect the rooms following the MST

--

Missing room generation and addition of more hallways
